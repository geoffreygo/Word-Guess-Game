# Word-Guess-Game

SUPER hangman!!

What's so super about it? SUPERheroes! Every word is the name of a superhero, some of them not so mainstream, so you will need
to dig deep into super-lore to figure them out!

As you guess letters that aren't in the word, you will see yourself being hung part by part (gruesome!). If you guess the word
correctly, the game will tell you how many times you've won. Also, wait a few seconds and it will give you a new word to guess.

Good luck!
